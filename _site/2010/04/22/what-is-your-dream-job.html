  <h1>What Is Your Dream Job?</h1>
<p class="gist">If we know what our dream job looks like we can start making it a <a href="http://macournoyer.com/blog/2010/03/23/goals/">goal</a>.  Write it down and you&#8217;ll have more chances to see it through.</p>
<p>I feel so privileged to work in the era of the web.  The internet has been such a liberating force and I believe that it&#8217;s just the beginning.  Some old dinosaurs are dying and making place for the new.  I want to be that new.</p>
<p>In the past 6 months I&#8217;ve lost my job, co-founded a <a href="http://talkerapp.com/">startup</a>, <a href="http://talkerapp.tumblr.com/post/536387940/talker-acquired-by-teambox">sold it</a> and joined another startup to work in the world of wines.  In 6 months I&#8217;ve gone through more jobs than my father did in his entire lifetime.</p>
<p>When you get to experience multiple different workplaces you get to discover things you didn&#8217;t think were possible.  At <a href="http://standoutjobs.com/">StandoutJobs</a> we used group chat as an integral part of our workflow and played video games daily during lunch breaks.  This team worked better together than any other team I&#8217;ve worked with in my life.</p>
<p>I think anyone on that team will have a hard time settling with old school type work.   We&#8217;d feel less productive and most likely less happy.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written down what my ideal job should bring me and shared it with friends and family.  I actually went one step further.  I made the promise that if I complained about my job <a href="http://blog.davidchouinard.com/post/537130573/get-the-fuck-out">I will leave it</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My ideal job is one where I would learn transferable skills, be challenged by the experience and change the old ways of doing things. I will run away from artificial ceilings and red tape because I&#8217;m too lucky to live today with a passion for the web.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s your ideal job?</p>

  <h1>5 Actions That Made Me Happier</h1>
<p class="gist">Happiness is not universally quantifiable but money is.  At some point in my life I raced towards money because I could measure it.  When I noticed it wasn&#8217;t making me happier I set out to make happiness my main goal.  Here is a list of actions I took.</p>
<h2>1. Reduced Commute Time</h2>
<p>Commuting is a  side effect of many jobs and sadly the higher the salary the more commute time we&#8217;re willing to do.  Finding ways to shave off commute time has a proven benefit as measured by this <a href="http://www.cces.ethz.ch/agsam2009/panels/AGSAM2009_panel_mobility_Stutzer.pdf">study (<span class="caps">PDF</span>)</a>.</p>
<p>When changing jobs wasn&#8217;t a possibility I used public transportation and got an internet capable cellphone so I could deal with paperwork related annoyances during the commute.  Instead of trying to find time at home I&#8217;d deal with them while in traffic.  I also borrowed and bought a few books.</p>
<p>Today my job allows me to work from home and my commute takes about 38 seconds.  I still need to commute a few days a week but I can choose to take the car and avoid rush hour traffic.</p>
<h2>2. Removed Small Frustrations</h2>
<p>I start every day by making some tea.  I had this cheap kettle that would randomly turn off on me.  One day after pouring cold water over tea leaves I decided to drive to the store.  Now every morning I look at the testament of a foregone frustration with a smile from ear to ear.</p>
<p>Removing frustrations can be as simple as moving the furniture or spending a few bucks.</p>
<h2>3. Played Sports</h2>
<p>A Harvard University study started in 1937 that spanned 72 years determined that <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/06/what-makes-us-happy/7439/">healthy play can relieve daily frustrations making us happier overall</a>.</p>
<p>A few years ago I joined a volleyball team and now I play a minimum of once a week.</p>
<h2>4. Attended Regular Meetups</h2>
<p>Would doubling your income make you happier?  Well it turns out that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/opinion/30brooks.html">seeing a group of people that meets just once a month</a> provided the same benefit as doubling your salary.</p>
<p>Once I started digging I found out that Montreal was vibrant and full of user groups and programming language enthusiasts that meet regularly.  I&#8217;ve met some really interesting people through these groups and some of the contacts even helped me professionally.</p>
<h2>5. Drank Socially With Co-Workers</h2>
<p>When work sucks your life sucks.  A good team <a href="http://talkerapp.tumblr.com/post/347650818/crack-that-joke">feels comfortable cracking a joke to the <span class="caps">CEO</span></a>.  Imagine how many valid concerns are not expressed if a team has to worry about everything they say.</p>
<p>Good communication is perhaps the reason why those who occasionally have a single drink after work with colleagues make <a href="http://www.zevgroup.com/socialdrinking.html">significantly more money</a> on average than those who do not drink at all. Team members who do drink are probably made aware of problems and can resolve situation before they occur.  It&#8217;s a different setting and we all know that a little alcohol can make shyness go away.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s perhaps a stretch to make this point but seriously having a drink has some beneficial effect on the time you spend at work and that can&#8217;t all be bad since you&#8217;re there a good portion of your day.</p>

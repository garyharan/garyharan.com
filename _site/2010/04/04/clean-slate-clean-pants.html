  <h1>5 Actions To Make You Happier</h1>
<p class="meta">April 4th Montreal</p>
<p class="gist">Happiness is not universally quantifiable but money is.  Our brains races towards quantifiable goals at the expense of happiness.</p>
<h2>1. Reduce your commute time</h2>
<p>Happiness is not measurable in the same way that salary is.  There are no metrics for what makes us happy so we tend to race towards what is quantifiable &#8211; high salary.  If we spend just a little more quality time away with family and friends our lives are richer and more fulfilling.  Sometimes taking a lower paying job makes sense if it means you spend more time doing what you love.  If the money you make does not help you do what you love you&#8217;re a sucker.</p>
<p>Commuting is a sad side effect of many jobs and sadly the higher the salary the more commute time we&#8217;re willing to do each day.  Finding ways to shave off commute time has a proven benefit as measure by this <a href="http://www.cces.ethz.ch/agsam2009/panels/AGSAM2009_panel_mobility_Stutzer.pdf">research (<span class="caps">PDF</span>)</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Remove Small Frustrations</h2>
<p>I start every day by putting a kettle on to make some tea.  The kettle I used to have wouldn&#8217;t turn on properly. I had to jiggle the button and it sometimes turned off on me.  I <strong>wrote down</strong> that it frustrated me.  The next time I was at the store for something unrelated I spend 40$ on a beautiful aluminum kettle that starts my day better than ever before.  Whenever I look at this new kettle I smile and think about how I used to be frustrated but now it&#8217;s all pleasure.</p>
<p>What frustrates you repeatedly?</p>
<h2>3. Play</h2>
<p>A <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/06/what-makes-us-happy/7439/">Harvard University study started in 1937</a> and spanned 72 years determined that sports (or play of some kind) can relieve daily frustrations and make you happier overall.</p>
<p>So maybe having a set of darts at home is a good idea.</p>
<h2>4. Have Regular Meetups With People</h2>
<p>Would doubling your income make you happier?  Well it turns out that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/opinion/30brooks.html">regularly seeing people</a> provide the same benefit as doubling your salary.</p>
<h2>5. Have a Drink With Co-Workers</h2>
<p>People who occasionally have a single drink after work with colleagues make <a href="http://www.zevgroup.com/socialdrinking.html">more money</a> on average than those who do not drink at all.  It turns out that socializing is a happiness boost too so you&#8217;re winning on all aspects here.  If you&#8217;re smart you&#8217;ll take the extra money and spend it on a well deserved vacation but that&#8217;s for another list.</p>

   <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;5 Actions That Made Me Happier&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;gist&quot;&gt;Happiness is not universally quantifiable but money is.  At some point in my life I raced towards money because I could measure it.  When I noticed it wasn&amp;#8217;t making me happier I set out to make happiness my main goal.  Here is a list of actions I took.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Reduced Commute Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commuting is a  side effect of many jobs and sadly the higher the salary the more commute time we&amp;#8217;re willing to do.  Finding ways to shave off commute time has a proven benefit as measured by this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cces.ethz.ch/agsam2009/panels/AGSAM2009_panel_mobility_Stutzer.pdf&quot;&gt;study (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When changing jobs wasn&amp;#8217;t a possibility I used public transportation and got an internet capable cellphone so I could deal with paperwork related annoyances during the commute.  Instead of trying to find time at home I&amp;#8217;d deal with them while in traffic.  I also borrowed and bought a few books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today my job allows me to work from home and my commute takes about 38 seconds.  I still need to commute a few days a week but I can choose to take the car and avoid rush hour traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Removed Small Frustrations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start every day by making some tea.  I had this cheap kettle that would randomly turn off on me.  One day after pouring cold water over tea leaves I decided to drive to the store.  Now every morning I look at the testament of a foregone frustration with a smile from ear to ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removing frustrations can be as simple as moving the furniture or spending a few bucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Played Sports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Harvard University study started in 1937 that spanned 72 years determined that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/06/what-makes-us-happy/7439/&quot;&gt;healthy play can relieve daily frustrations making us happier overall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I joined a volleyball team and now I play a minimum of once a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Attended Regular Meetups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would doubling your income make you happier?  Well it turns out that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/opinion/30brooks.html&quot;&gt;seeing a group of people that meets just once a month&lt;/a&gt; provided the same benefit as doubling your salary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I started digging I found out that Montreal was vibrant and full of user groups and programming language enthusiasts that meet regularly.  I&amp;#8217;ve met some really interesting people through these groups and some of the contacts even helped me professionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Drank Socially With Co-Workers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When work sucks your life sucks.  A good team &lt;a href=&quot;http://talkerapp.tumblr.com/post/347650818/crack-that-joke&quot;&gt;feels comfortable cracking a joke to the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Imagine how many valid concerns are not expressed if a team has to worry about everything they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good communication is perhaps the reason why those who occasionally have a single drink after work with colleagues make &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zevgroup.com/socialdrinking.html&quot;&gt;significantly more money&lt;/a&gt; on average than those who do not drink at all. Team members who do drink are probably made aware of problems and can resolve situation before they occur.  It&amp;#8217;s a different setting and we all know that a little alcohol can make shyness go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s perhaps a stretch to make this point but seriously having a drink has some beneficial effect on the time you spend at work and that can&amp;#8217;t all be bad since you&amp;#8217;re there a good portion of your day.&lt;/p&gt;
